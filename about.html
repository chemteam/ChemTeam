Chem Team was created to fill up the dreadfully empty void of a lecture group for competitive chemistry competitions in TJ. We help prepare for the Chemistry Olympiad exam, and well as a few other exams throughout the year. We give a series of lectures following the AP Chemistry curriculum, and expand upon some topics or delve into new topics at the end of the year.
